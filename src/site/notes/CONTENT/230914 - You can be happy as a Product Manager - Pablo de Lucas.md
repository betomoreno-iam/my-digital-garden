Hi there,

I hope youâ€™re having a blast! I know the title of this post can be difficult to understand for non-PMs. However, PMs most likely know what Iâ€™m talking about. I believe the role of the Product Manager is one of the toughest ones to have as an IC. Why?

## Why Itâ€™s Tough

1. **Ambiguity**: Unlike more defined roles, a Product Managerâ€™s responsibilities can be nebulous. Youâ€™re often expected to be a jack-of-all-trades, which can be mentally exhausting.
2. **Decision Overload**: Youâ€™re the go-to person for making decisions that affect the product, from feature prioritization to release timelines. The weight of these decisions can be stressful.
3. **Stakeholder Management**: Youâ€™re at the intersection of business, technology, and user experience. Balancing the needs and wants of different stakeholders is a constant juggling act.
4. **Ownership Without Authority**: Youâ€™re responsible for the productâ€™s success but may not have the authority to make all the decisions affecting it. This can lead to feelings of powerlessness.
5. **High Expectations**: The tech industry is known for its fast-paced, high-expectation culture. The pressure to deliver can be relentless.
6. **Fear of Failure**: Tech is an industry that celebrates innovation but is also unforgiving of mistakes. The fear of launching a failed product can be a significant source of stress.

## What You Can Do as a PM

1. **Clarity in Role**: Clearly define your responsibilities and set boundaries. This can help reduce ambiguity and the stress associated with it.
2. **Prioritization**: Use frameworks like MoSCoW or RICE to prioritize tasks and features. This can help in decision-making and time management.
3. **Communication**: Open and frequent communication with stakeholders can alleviate some stress. Make sure everyone is aligned on goals and expectations.
4. **Self-Care**: Given your interest in psychology and philosophy, techniques like mindfulness or Stoic practices could be beneficial for stress management.
5. **Mentorship and Peer Support**: Sometimes talking to someone whoâ€™s been in your shoes can provide invaluable insights and stress relief.
6. **Work-Life Balance**: Easier said than done, especially in tech, but crucial. Make time for your interests and side projects to recharge.
7. **Mindfulness and Reflection**: Given your interest in psychology and philosophy, incorporating mindfulness techniques or regular periods of reflection could be beneficial.
8. **Realign Expectations**: Sometimes unhappiness stems from a gap between expectations and reality. Periodic realignment can help manage stress levels.

## Dialogos with Pablo De Lucas

After covering some of the intangibles that make the role of the Product Manager difficult and what you can do to mitigate that, I want to share with you the first edition of the DiaLogos podcast.

A few days ago I had a conversation with an ex-colleague and friend Pablo. He is a Senior Product Manager at Adevinta, with a wealth of knowledge about the role(s) of the Product Manager. It was really fun to talk with Pablo, we briefly talked about how to stay motivated as a Product Manager, and some of the pros and cons of working remotely. Most of our conversation was about the role of the Product Manager beyond what can be read in the literature. If it sounds interesting, here you have the recording.

This time, the conversation is in Spanish ðŸ˜„. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
