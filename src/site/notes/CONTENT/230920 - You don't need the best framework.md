# You don't need the best framework as a Product Manager

Hi there,

I hope you’re doing fantastic. Today I want to share some thoughts for Product Managers (note to myself ✍ ):

The overwhelming amount of content out there can easily become noise, distracting from the real work that needs to be done. Information isn’t transformation.

You don’t need to follow more people, you don’t need more reminders about what is the best or latest framework to use, and you don’t need to justify your actions or find “permission” to do what you want to do based on what someone else (even if they are big influencers) post.

Most of you already know what needs to be done:

1. **Become an Expert**: Can’t emphasize this enough. Expertise is your currency. You can’t manage what you don’t understand. Period. Know your market, know your customers, know your numbers, know your **PRODUCT**.

2. **Work with People**: Soft skills are hard skills. The way you manage your team, your relationships, and even manage up are crucial elements for success. Communicate, Collaborate, Lead & Follow.

3. **Master Execution**: The road to hell is paved with good intentions—and unshipped products. A good PM is a closer. Set the course and get it done. Define a vision, goals, strategy, and roadmap. Ship products you’re proud of. Ensure your users, customers, and prospects know about it. Observe what happens and iterate.

4. **Work on Your Character**: Your technical skills may get you in the door, but your character keeps you in the room. Be curious, have a growth mindset, and be kind to people. Invest in yourself as a person, not just a professional.

Is this an exhaustive list? No

is this everything you really need to become successful at your job? Yes

If you need upskilling in a specific area (we all do) -> **focus is key.** Pinpoint what you’re lacking and go deep for a period of time, whether it’s a new methodology or a particular aspect of your market.

Consuming more content or following more influencers won’t magically elevate your skills; focused effort and application will.

The rest of information consumption is just entertainment (or procrastination).

Do you want to know how did I reach this conclusion? I could add links to tons of articles, books, presentations, talks, podcasts, and so on that I’ve consumed over the past 10 years to distill this. You don’t really need it. Focus on the work that is in front of you, and think deeply to identify what is needed and work on it.

And as always, remember to have FUN!
