Hi there,

This Friday I want my notes about the piece of content that has changed my mindset the most during this week, I hope you find it useful. Enjoy.

Over the past 2 months, an important part of my energy has been dedicated to improving team operations. After an important change at the company, we had to revisit some of our practices and stare face-to-face at some workflows that were not working as well as they could. I’ve been working with the teams and also finding inspiration outside the company to define and implement a few initiatives to help us with some key areas such as internal communication.

In my explorations, I came across a [very interesting podcast from no other than Tim Ferris, with his guest Sam Corcos, Founder](https://tim.blog/2023/09/20/sam-corcos/) and CEO at Levels. This conversation made me rethink a few foundational assumptions about Company Culture, Transparency, and Communication. I had to listen to this podcast a couple of times to take notes and make it into new experiments and habits. I have shared it with a few of my friends and colleagues, and I want to do the same with you. I not only listened and took notes for action, but I also dug deeper into their company documents, which are also really inspiring.

Some of the quotes and key points that stood out to me:

- “A lack of **communication** is a lack of **performance**“
- “Culture is the set of assumptions you can make from people without having interacted with them before”
- “Gossip is the organizational chronic inflammation”. Transparency is one of the most effective treatments
- Sam’s approach to task and calendar management
- Thoughts on Organizational Entropy and Transparency

Here are some other links that I believe are really interesting:

This podcast hit home (the right info at the right time). What will I do, experiment, and bring more focus to:

1. Book reads:
    1. Re-read: [Lean Startup](https://amzn.to/466FjbJ) & [Nonviolent Communication](https://amzn.to/45jaq2A)
    2. Read: [No Rules Rules](https://amzn.to/466FjbJ)
2. **Use my calendar as my to-do list**. I will still keep a backlog, but the calendar will be the source of truth for when things will happen
3. **Embrace content creation**, that scales better than meetings:
    1. Document more and better – Writing is thinking
    2. Record more videos: To share my thoughts, meetings to reduce the “let’s also invite Alice” effect
    3. Everything that can be done async, do it async. Status updates, Decision-making, planning,…
4. **Talent over processes**. Treat people like adults. Build trust, and share more honest feedback, which will also reduce gossip (organization’s chronic inflammation)
5. **Remember the effects of Entropy at all times**. I already tend to be quite essentialist, but it made me think about all areas of the product and product management. Each new surface (product screen, documentation, code-base, recurrent communications, process, …) deteriorates from the moment it is launched. The solution is to either have an automated system for keeping it up to date or to reduce the surface. Be more mindful about that.

If this resonates, I encourage you to listen to the full episode.

Be mindful.
