# On Discipline
Be careful with prolong sitting. I'm reminded that sitting is a killer.
I'm reminded that our current environment does not help our biology.

# On Management
## Outputs vs Outcomes
In Tech Product Management there seems to be an agreement that the ideal scenario is to have teams be outcome driven (instead of output driven). While this is the ideal, almost everyone falls short of that ideal. 
From a business perspective it does make sense to focus on outcomes, at the end of the day, they are the only thing that will ensure the company survives and thrives, but as a managing tool, they don't tell you what to do.
There is a hidden presupposition in the "Managing by Outcomes" camp -> To manage based on outcomes requires a talented team that will be able to have the mindset of embracing the uncertainty of going somewhere without knowing how. Not only that, it requires the leaders to understand the potential side-effects of a talented team focusing on an outcome, as all the scenarios that could happen because the team was tasked with achieve a specific result, might happen.

Should we all do what is cool? (Outcomes driven management) What is the right level of granularity for this approach?
