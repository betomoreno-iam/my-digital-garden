Hi there, I hope you’re doing great!

# Who Am I?

I’m Beto Moreno, a [seasoned Product Leader with a wealth of experience in the tech industry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/albertomor/). I’m your go-to guy for all things product, tech, and a sprinkle of philosophy. I’m currently steering the ship as the Product Director at Factorial, where I oversee the Core Components Domain. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg.

# The Essence of Beto

I’m not just a Product Leader; I’m a systems thinker, a value creator, and a relentless learner. My mind is a playground where tech meets business, psychology dances with philosophy, and curiosity fuels growth.

# My Odyssey in Tech

## The Genesis

I kicked off my career with a robust blend of engineering and business acumen. From HVAC systems to software development, I’ve been in the trenches, and that’s where my love for tech was born.

## The Ascendancy

My journey took a pivotal turn when I stepped into leadership roles. As a **Group Product Manager at Roca Group**, I orchestrated product strategies across the Asia-Pacific, mastering the art of cross-functional leadership.

At **Haufe Group**, as a **Product Lead**, I was the catalyst for organizational transformation. I scaled the product team, defined visionary roadmaps, and embedded a culture of Ownership, Curiosity, and Collaboration.

## The Zenith

**Factorial** is where I’ve hit my stride. From **Product Lead** to **Head of Product**, and now as the **Product Director**, each role has been a masterclass in leadership, strategy, and adaptability.

## My North Stars

- **Growth Mindset**: Challenges? Bring ’em on!
- **Curiosity & Adaptability**: Every day is a new lesson.
- **Transparency**: Honesty isn’t a policy; it’s a lifestyle.
- **Collaboration**: Together, we achieve the extraordinary.
- **Ownership**: I own my actions, 100%.

# Beyond the Screen

When I unplug, I dive into the depths of psychology, philosophy, and cognitive science. I’m a disciple of Integral Theory and a student of life’s complexities. I share these musings on my blog and YouTube channel.

# What I Advocate

- **Essentialism**: Zero in on what truly matters.
- **Deep Work**: Depth over breadth, always.
- **Humanity**: In an AI world, our edge is our humanity.

# My Outputs

I write about Product Management, Business in general, Tech and Innovation and I share tools and frameworks to navigate the present and the future.
